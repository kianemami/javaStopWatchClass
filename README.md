# javaStopWatchClass
java stop watch utility

It is very simple to use and conveniently fast enough

just make an instance of this class and use startTimer() and when your job is finished use endTimer() then just get elapsed time by
getTimeElapsed(),it returns the value of -1 if you didn't use endTimer() otherwise you get time in millisecond
